### Installing Git and CMAKE
Before we can begin, you must install Git, a version control system which you need for handing in your assignments, and for keeping track of your progress. We refer you to the online [Pro Git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) for more information. There you will also find [instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git]) on how to to install it. We recommend using [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) for as a GUI for Git.

We use CMake for cross-platform builds. You can download it from: [https://cmake.org/download/](https://cmake.org/download/), but we recommend installing it with a package manager instead.

On Windows use  [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/install), run command line as administrator and type
```
choco install cmake.install
```
On Debian/Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```
or with MacPorts on macOS:
```
sudo port install cmake.
```

### Building the code
Use the CMAKE gui as explained in class to create a visual studio solution, or use your compiler/IDE of choice.
**Never push the build folder to the remote repository!**

Once the solution has been generated, open it with visual studio. Check that it compiles and runs.
